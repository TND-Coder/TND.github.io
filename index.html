      This is me working for CNN on the floor at the DNC. I did the same for the RNC. (One of the cameramen, Steve, told me to turn around and smile. I listened.) </span>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Thomas, and I'm in the first-year of a J.D.-Ph.D. at Harvard University and the University of Oxford.
      In 2024, I graduated with honors from the University of Chicago with degrees in economics and philosophy, making what I hope to be many lifelong friends along the way. This website, as you might guess, is a work in progress.

      Right now (last updated on [Date]), I'm:

      <h2 id="words">II. Writing</h2>
      Here's a quick look through a few public-facing things I've written. I haven't finished consolidating everything here, so feel free to <a href="#socials">reach out</a> and check if you're looking for a particular genre of writing that isn't below, there's a chance I have it anyway.
      <h3>Nonfiction</h3>

    <p>
      I'm not on Instagram and only nominally have a Facebook.

      If you want to email me, you can use
      <code class="language-python"> "thomas.dorsey" + "@" + "balliol.ox.ac.uk"</code><br>
    </p>

    <h2 id="feedback">V. Leave me anonymous feedback!</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that I ought to be the best version of myself that I can. I aspire
      to change my mind as I see new evidence, and it's very important to me that
      I balance the knowledge that I could be totally wrong with the push to 
      actually do the things I think are right.
